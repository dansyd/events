Like its counterparts across the world, Sydney has been in a constant state of building, unbuilding and rebuilding as it has grown into the metropolis of today. The mix of Georgian, Victorian, Art Deco and modernist buildings that have formed the character of Sydney also tell the story of its changing fortunes, attitudes and needs.

Demolished Sydney reveals this process of urban evolution through key buildings that have been demolished and replaced. Through fragments salvaged from theatres, hotels and office blocks, alongside stunning photography, artworks and film, Demolished Sydney brings back to life the heritage of a Sydney that is gone but not forgotten.', :image => 'demolished-sydney_bbsadh'
